## My Dotfiles
This repository is made up of different setup files and scripts. 
## Installing tools
I created a Makefile that is made up of two different targets being a linux and clean. Both which run a corresponding script such as linux.sh and cleanup.sh. You can run these targets using make <target> to call the respective scripts. 
## Clean up
You can run make clean to revert the changes that was caused by the other script.
